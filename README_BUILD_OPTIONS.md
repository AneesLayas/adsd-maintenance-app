# Build Options for Limited Resources

## Problem
Your VM doesn't have enough CPU/RAM to build the Flutter APK locally.

## Solutions

### 1. GitHub Actions (FREE - Recommended)
- Push your code to GitHub
- The workflow file `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml` will automatically build your APK
- Download the built APK from the Actions tab
- **Pros**: Free, no resource usage on your machine, automatic builds
- **Cons**: Requires GitHub account and internet

**Steps:**
1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Push your code: `git push origin main`
3. Go to GitHub Actions tab
4. Download the APK artifact after build completes

### 2. Optimized Local Build
Use the provided `build_optimized.bat` script which:
- Limits memory usage to 1GB
- Disables unnecessary features
- Builds only for ARM64 (smaller build)

**Steps:**
1. Close all other applications
2. Run: `build_optimized.bat`
3. Wait for completion (may take 30-60 minutes)

### 3. Cloud Build Services

#### Codemagic (Free tier available)
- Sign up at codemagic.io
- Connect your repository
- Free 500 build minutes per month
- Automatic APK generation

#### Azure DevOps (Free)
- 1800 minutes/month free
- Similar to GitHub Actions
- Good for Microsoft ecosystem

#### Firebase App Distribution + GitHub Actions
- Automatic deployment after build
- Good for team distribution

### 4. Local Optimization Tips

If you must build locally:

1. **Increase Virtual Memory:**
```batch
# Increase page file size to 4GB+
Control Panel > System > Advanced > Performance Settings > Advanced > Virtual Memory
```

2. **Close Background Apps:**
- Close browsers, IDEs, media players
- Stop unnecessary Windows services

3. **Use Split APK Build:**
```bash
flutter build apk --split-per-abi --release
```

4. **Build for Specific Architecture:**
```bash
# For most modern devices (smaller build)
flutter build apk --release --target-platform android-arm64
```

### 5. Pre-built APK Download
If you just need a working APK and don't need custom changes:
- Check if there's a release section in your project
- Download from CI/CD artifacts
- Use the latest successful build

## Resource Requirements Comparison

| Method | CPU | RAM | Time | Cost |
|--------|-----|-----|------|------|
| GitHub Actions | None | None | 10-15 min | Free |
| Codemagic | None | None | 8-12 min | Free tier |
| Local Optimized | 2+ cores | 4GB+ | 30-60 min | Free |
| Local Full | 4+ cores | 8GB+ | 15-30 min | Free |

## Recommended Workflow

1. **For Development**: Use GitHub Actions
2. **For Testing**: Download APK from artifacts
3. **For Production**: Set up automated releases

## Next Steps

1. Choose your preferred method above
2. For GitHub Actions: Push your code to GitHub
3. For local build: Run `build_optimized.bat`
4. For cloud services: Sign up and connect your repo

The APK will be compatible with Android 5.0+ devices and include all the offline maintenance report features described in your project.
